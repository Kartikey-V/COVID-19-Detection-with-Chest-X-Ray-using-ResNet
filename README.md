# COVID-19 Detection with Chest X-Ray using ResNet

In this project, an Image Classification Model using Residual Neural Networks (ResNet) has been used to classify image samples of chest X-Ray into 3 classes namely 'Normal', 'Viral' and 'Covid'.

ResNet-18 model of PyTorch Library was used and 15k+ images from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) were used to train the model using a 30:70 Split
